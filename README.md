# tweet-tweet #

This app was designed to read in two text files, namely *user.txt* and *tweet.txt* and print to the console a pre-defined output.
<br/>

The format of the *user.txt* file was as follows:

`Ward follows Alan`
<br/>
`Alan follows Martin`
<br/>
`Ward follows Martin, Alan`

<br/>

The format of the *tweet.txt* file was as follows:

`Alan> If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some.`
<br/>
`Ward> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-1 errors.`
<br/>
`Alan> Random numbers should not be generated with a method chosen at random.`
<br/>
